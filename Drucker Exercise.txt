Terrence:
1. Problem solving and thinking. I’m good with hardware repairs and technical knowledge about issues.
2. I perform well when I’m by myself or when it’s quiet. If not, I like small groups so that we don’t have many people talking over each other. I perform well when introduced to hard challenges and like to use my resources to figure out said challenge.
3. I value experience and wisdom. I think teaching is great, but hands-on experience seems to be much better than me just learning. I value applying skills I’ve learned or adapting to the environment to add new skills.
4. I would like to learn more about AI and LLM’s and hope to work on it within the project.
